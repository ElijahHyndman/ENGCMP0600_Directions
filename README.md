# So You Want To Change 
# Your Brake Pads?
*There are better resources than github.*

Proactive drivers will find mile-markers in the Glove Compartment's owners manual which dictates mile-markers to replace brake pads. For everyone else, there are a few indicators. Your braking could feel sloppy. You may hear a grinding from your wheels as the wear indicator touches the rotor. Your brake pad may fall out at a red light. \
All of these indicate that it's time for a change. 


Gather Tools
    >>    You want to acquire \
    >>      - `Breaker Bar` for breaking nuts and `Rachet` for finishing them (Are they Metric or SAE spec?) \
    >>      - `Jack` and `Stands`  \
    >>      - `Torque Wrench` non-negotiable  \
    >>      - `Brake Pads` (preferrably new ones)  \
    >>      - `Antiseize` if you want to enjoy this job the next time.
1. Break Nuts
    >> You can't break them while the wheels are spinning so now is the time to do it with your `breaker bar`.
1. Lift Car
    >> Apply your e-brake. 
    >> Most new cars like to hide the Jack spots. Be careful, be mindful, place it right the first time. 
    >> You don't want the car held up by the `jack` while working. 
    >> Once high enough, place the `stands` under the frame near the wheels. 
1. Undo Lug Nuts and Remove Wheel
    >> They should spin freely now. Take them in whatever order you like. 
1. Undo Caliper Bolt
    >> There are **4** bolts you'll find on the caliper. 
    >> `2` hold the Caliper Bracket to the rotor, and `2` hold the Caliper Body to the Caliper Bracket
    >> We just need to remove the Caliper Body for the pads. 
    >> You can get away with removing just `1` with your `rachet` and swiveling the Caliper Body away
1. Lift Away Caliper
    >> Just removing 1 bolt allows us to avoid putting stress on your fragile,  fragile brake line.
1. Wrench Away Old Pads
    >> A screwdriver works if they are stubborn. Be very cautious not to nick the Brake Rotors if you want to use the same ones after.
**Tip: Apply `Antiseize` to the anti-rattle clips where the pads touch** 
1. Place New Pads In
    >> Place the black, carbonaceous side against the rotor. 
    >> One in four pads may have a ware indicator pin, don't worry about it. 
1. Close Caliper and Tighten Bolts
    >> It's a good idea to torque these down.
1. Put Wheel On Using Lug Nuts
    >> Wrestle the wheel on and attempt to get one nut one. Hand tighten the rest.
1. Lower Your Car
    >> Slightly lift with the `jack`, remove the `stands`, and let the car down gently. 
1. **Torque Them Down**
    >> Now that they won't squirrel away, torque them down. 
    >> Find the right ft-lbs to torque and serivice them in a *star pattern*.
